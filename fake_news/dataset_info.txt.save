The dataset includes fake&real news propagation (retweet) networks on Twitter built according to fact-check information from Politifact and Gossipcop. The news retweet graphs were originally extracted by FakeNewsNet. Each graph is a hierarchical tree-structured graph where the root node represents the news; the leaf nodes are Twitter users who retweeted the root news. A user node has an edge to the news node if he/she retweeted the news tweet. Two user nodes have an edge if one user retweeted the news tweet from the other user.
