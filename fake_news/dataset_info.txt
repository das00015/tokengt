The dataset has been integrated with Pytorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL). You can load the dataset after installing the latest versions of PyG or DGL.

The UPFD dataset includes two sets of tree-structured graphs curated for evaluating binary graph classification, graph anomaly detection, and fake/real news detection tasks. The dataset is dumped in the form of Pytorch-Geometric dataset object. You can easily load the data and run various GNN models using PyG.

The dataset includes fake&real news propagation (retweet) networks on Twitter built according to fact-check information from Politifact and Gossipcop. The news retweet graphs were originally extracted by FakeNewsNet. Each graph is a hierarchical tree-structured graph where the root node represents the news; the leaf nodes are Twitter users who retweeted the root news. A user node has an edge to the news node if he/she retweeted the news tweet. Two user nodes have an edge if one user retweeted the news tweet from the other user.
Four different node features are encoded using different encoders.
